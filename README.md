This is a project created for fun. 

## About .env
If someone wants to reuse this, there are three Environment Variables needed. 
These are for the form at the end of the application. This form sends an email to you whenever someone enters into it. 

EMAIL_TO - your email to RECEIVE the emails
EMAIL_USERNAME - your email to SEND the emails 
EMAIL_PASSWORD - your password for the SEND email 
This uses nodemailer - [learn more here](https://nodemailer.com/usage/).
